## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun game played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Two players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create an interactive Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in any modern web browser. The game features a clean, intuitive design and responsive user interface.

## Project Status

The project was started on December 8, 2023, and has been successfully completed. Enjoy playing!
